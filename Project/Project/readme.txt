After you have extracted the ”Project.zip” folder provided to you, open Gama and import the Project - v1.gaml model
found in the extracted folder called ”Project”. The experiments can be run by clicking the MyExperiment
button. The model can be tweaked using the following parameters:
• partyPersonCount, sportsPersonCount, historyPersonCount, readingPersonCount and gamingPersonCount
control the number of created agents of each type
• typePlaceModifiers and placeTraitModifiers determines the default experience of an agent in a location
and how that location amplifies or weakens the influence of certain traits, during a conversation
with another agent respectively.
• The visual representation of each agent can be altered by changing the base aspect. Colour, shape
and size can be set here.
